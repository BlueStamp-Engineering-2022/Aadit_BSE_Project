# Alexa for Home Automation
This project allows you to ask Alexa to get temperature and humidity data from the Particle Photon microcontroller, which gets readings from a DHT22 sensor. In addition, you can also ask Alexa to get the Particle to turn 2 different LED lights on and off. After finishing these tasks, you can make Alexa do many custom jobs around the household, such as locking doors, adjusting the thermostat, etc.

# Starter Project

My starter project is the Simon Says Game. When a certain button is pressed, the LED under it lights up, and marks it correct or wrong according to the software built into the microcontroller provided for the game. Also provided is a buzzer to release sound when a button is pressed, capacitors to regulate electric flow, batteries, on-off switches for both the power and the sound, a resistor, the board, and the buttons. The different components of the game were soldered to the board, except for the buttons which were screwed.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the Raspberry Pi and all the necessary components onto my tv. The heatsinks, the sd card, and the controller were all added to ensure that the Raspberry Pi was working. Instead of the Raspberry Pi Os software, I had to first download a different software called Retro Pie. With Retro Pie, I needed to download an Imager for Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi Imager automatically downloads a list of the latest versions of Raspbian supported by the Raspberry Pi. Raspbian is the typical Raspberry Pi Os software, the one I needed on the Raspberry Pi was Retro Pi. With the included SD card, I plugged in the SD into my computer and launched the Imager. The imager allowed me to set the Operating System to Retro Pi instead of Raspbian onto the SD card. With the OS imaged onto the SD, I plugged the SD card back into the Raspberry Pi and rebooted the system and Retro Bi booted up.
