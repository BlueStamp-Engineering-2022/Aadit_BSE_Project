# Alexa for Home Automation
This project allows you to ask Alexa to get temperature and humidity data from the Particle Photon microcontroller, which gets readings from a DHT22 sensor. In addition, you can also ask Alexa to get the Particle to turn 2 different LED lights on and off. After finishing these tasks, you can make Alexa do many custom jobs around the household, such as locking doors, adjusting the thermostat, etc.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone integrates Alexa into my particle design. Now the alexa can turn on the LEDs on and off from voice commands, and it can also request temperature from the DHT11 sensor. In addition, I created a google spreadsheet for the temperature and humidity data, so that the data is readily available with a timestamp to show when the reading happened, as well as a graph to show how the temperature in your household or outside will change over time. I also created an animation and a website to show how the entire project works

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up a device Particle to make it turn an LED on and off, as well as reading humidity and temperature off a DHT11 sensor. This all will happen through voice commands from Alexa, so that is my second milestone goal. The DHT11 sensor gives an accurate temperature and humidity reading, and it publishes the data to the particle console.

# Starter Project

My starter project is the Simon Says Game. When a certain button is pressed, the LED under it lights up, and marks it correct or wrong according to the software built into the microcontroller provided for the game. Also provided is a buzzer to release sound when a button is pressed, capacitors to regulate electric flow, batteries, on-off switches for both the power and the sound, a resistor, the board, and the buttons. The different components of the game were soldered to the board, except for the buttons which were screwed.
